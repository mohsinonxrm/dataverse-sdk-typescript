## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- d9eebf3: **2.0.0.** Every package moves to 2.0.0 together. Most of 2.0 fixes code that didn't work against Dataverse in 1.0, and several changes alter existing behaviour. See [docs/migration-2.0.md](https://github.com/mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-typescript/blob/main/docs/migration-2.0.md) for what to change. In short:

  - **Install:** Node 22+. `@azure/msal-browser`, `@azure/msal-node`, and the OpenTelemetry and Azure Monitor packages are now peer dependencies of the auth and telemetry packages (#24, #85, #159).
  - **core:** nothing is logged by default. URLs in logs and telemetry are redacted.
  - **core, retries:** a `Retry-After` beyond `retry.maxRetryAfterMs` (30 s) is returned instead of waited out, and non-idempotent requests aren't replayed after 502/503/504.
  - **core, timeouts:** `timeoutMs` covers the whole request.
  - **core, pipeline:** the default middleware order is ODataHeaders, Retry, Concurrency, Auth, Telemetry, Logging.
  - **core, queries:** query options are encoded with `%20`, and `expand()` calls add up.
  - **core, removed options:** `RetryOptions.delay` and `useExponentialBackoff`, `circuitBreaker`, `bulkhead` and `DataverseError.statusCode` are gone (#285).
  - **errors:** every SDK error extends `DataverseError`. Network failures and aborts are `DataverseNetworkError` and `DataverseAbortError`. A 412 is a `DataverseDuplicateError` only for `0x80040333`.
  - **metadata:** enums are string member names, and creates return the id from `OData-EntityId`.
  - **xrm:** record ids must be GUIDs, and entity sets come from metadata. `execute()` infers its result from the request, and records are `EntityRecord` instead of `any`.
  - **discovery:** `OrganizationDetail` matches the v2.0 response.
  - **actions, functions, messages:**
    - constructors take one object with the parameters by name; a bound operation's record id or entity set comes first, and bulk operations take the entity set first (#96);
    - each binding of an overloaded operation has its own class, and the plain-name classes of bound-only operations are removed (#286);
    - one `EntityReference` for the whole SDK: `createEntityReference` returns the Web API shape and takes an options object (#295);
    - `client.execute()` resolves the operation's value, not the OData envelope: the entity (`null` for a 204), the array, the primitive, or nothing (#300);
    - `toRequestBody()` is removed.

  See each package's CHANGELOG for the full list.

### Minor Changes

- 5441c2a: `AzureIdentityTokenProvider` caches tokens (#86). The SDK asks for a token on every request, and the provider called `credential.getToken` every time, so with `AzureCliCredential`, `AzurePowerShellCredential` or `AzureDeveloperCliCredential` **every Dataverse request started an `az` / `pwsh` / `azd` process**. `DefaultAzureCredential` also walked its whole chain on every request.

  - Tokens are kept in memory per scope set and tenant until 5 minutes before they expire (new option `refreshMarginMs`, default `DEFAULT_REFRESH_MARGIN_MS`), or until the credential's `refreshAfterTimestamp` if that is earlier. Tokens that live less than twice the margin are refreshed at half their lifetime. Tokens without a usable expiry are not cached.
  - Concurrent requests that need a new token share one credential call.
  - If a refresh fails while the cached token is still valid, the cached token is returned and the next call tries again.
  - `TokenOptions.forceRefresh` (sent by the SDK after a 401) now skips this cache and calls the credential. Before, it was ignored. A claims challenge also skips the cache, and the token it returns replaces the cached one.
  - New option `cacheTokens: false` turns the cache off. The new method `clearTokenCache()` empties it.
  - Credential errors are kept as `cause` on the `DataverseAuthenticationError`, through the error constructor.
  - `package.json` `exports` lists `types` first, with `default` instead of `import`, so TypeScript always resolves the types.

### Patch Changes

- f363a6f: README: every TypeScript example type-checks against the 2.0 packages (#311); signature listings are marked as such. The msal-browser README drops MSAL's `storeAuthStateInCookie` (for Internet Explorer 11, deprecated in MSAL 4 and removed in MSAL 5) and describes Dataverse's CORS behaviour as the browser guide does; the appinsights `/browser` example passes a connection string it defines.
- 8c5cf39: Export `./package.json`, so `require("<package>/package.json")` and tools that read a package's version through it work.
- 6bbb784: Declare `engines: { "node": ">=22" }`. Node 18 and Node 20 are end of life (April 2025 and April 2026). CI now tests on Node 22, 24 and 26. Installing on an older Node shows an engine warning, or fails with `engine-strict`.
- 1ec85eb: Packaging fixes (#364):

  - appinsights: CommonJS apps can `require()` the package. It used top-level `await` to load its optional peers, which fails with `ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE`. `@azure/monitor-opentelemetry` and `@opentelemetry/resources` are now loaded on first use, only on the `connectionString` path, so an app that doesn't pass a connection string never loads the Azure Monitor distro.
  - auth-azure-identity: `@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-core` is a regular dependency, as in the other auth packages, instead of an exact-version peer dependency. As a peer it would have made every later minor release of the SDK a major one.

- 05a489a: The token providers act on `TokenOptions.forceRefresh` (#167), which the core client sets after a 401 (#21). Before, the 401 retry could receive the same cached token again.

  - **msal-node:** passes `skipCache: true` for client credentials, and `forceRefresh` in the silent flow.
  - **msal-browser:** passes `forceRefresh: true` to `acquireTokenSilent`.
  - **azure-identity:** `@azure/identity` has no refresh option, so the provider ignores `forceRefresh` and leaves caching to each credential; this is documented. A claims challenge is still passed on.

  - @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-core@2.0.0-beta.0

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 78fc1e1: Initial v1.0.0 release of Dataverse SDK for TypeScript

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [78fc1e1]
  - @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-core@1.0.0

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- # v1.0.0 - Initial Release 🎉

  The first stable release of the Dataverse SDK for TypeScript! This modern, type-safe SDK provides comprehensive access to Microsoft Dataverse (Power Platform) with two complementary front doors:
  1. **HTTP/OData Fluent API** - Microsoft Graph-inspired request builder pattern
  2. **OrganizationService** - C#-familiar interface for Dataverse developers

  ## 🚀 Key Features

  ### Core Infrastructure
  - **Middleware Pipeline** - Extensible request/response processing with auth, retry, concurrency, and telemetry
  - **Automatic Retries** - Smart retry logic honors `Retry-After` headers (429, 502+)
  - **Adaptive Concurrency** - Respects `x-ms-dop-hint` for optimal throughput
  - **Type-Safe** - Strict TypeScript throughout with 1,356+ generated message types
  - **ESM-Only** - Modern, tree-shakeable ES Modules for optimal bundle sizes

  ### Authentication
  - **MSAL Browser** - SPA/browser authentication with token caching
  - **MSAL Node** - CLI/daemon auth (device code, client credentials)
  - **Azure Identity** - Modern Azure authentication library support

  ### Operations
  - **$batch Operations** - Auto-splitting at 1,000 requests, change sets, error handling
  - **Typed Actions** - 1,356 generated action classes with full type safety
  - **Typed Functions** - 229 generated function classes
  - **Typed Messages** - 1,356 message request/response pairs (direct exports, no namespaces)
  - **Bulk Operations** - CreateMultiple, UpdateMultiple, UpsertMultiple, DeleteMultiple
  - **File Operations** - Chunked upload/download for file and image columns (4MB default chunks)

  ### Metadata
  - **Strict Typing** - Generated from Dataverse v9.2 metadata (Sales + Customer Service)
  - **Read/Create/Update Split** - Separate types prevent invalid writes
  - **Metadata Client** - Type-safe operations for EntityDefinitions, RelationshipDefinitions, etc.
  - **RetrieveMetadataChanges** - Efficient incremental metadata queries

  ### Developer Experience
  - **Two Front Doors** - Choose HTTP fluent API OR OrganizationService patterns
  - **Comprehensive Samples** - Node CLI, daemon, batch ops, file ops, metadata, messages
  - **Fluent Builders** - Chainable OData query building (select, filter, expand, orderby, etc.)
  - **Prefer Headers** - Type-safe helper for returnRepresentation, includeAnnotations, etc.
  - **Paging** - get(), getPage(), iterate(), getAll() with configurable limits

  ### Telemetry & Observability
  - **Application Insights** - Optional adapter package
  - **OpenTelemetry** - Optional adapter package
  - **Custom Telemetry** - Implement TelemetryClient interface
  - **Correlation IDs** - Automatic x-ms-client-request-id propagation

  ## 📦 Packages

  All packages published under `@mohsinonxrm` scope:

  **Foundation:**
  - `dataverse-sdk-core` - Pipeline, middleware, fluent API, request builder
  - `dataverse-sdk-entities-runtime` - Runtime for generated entities

  **Authentication:**
  - `dataverse-sdk-auth-msal-browser` - MSAL browser token provider
  - `dataverse-sdk-auth-msal-node` - MSAL node token provider
  - `dataverse-sdk-auth-azure-identity` - Azure Identity token provider

  **Core Operations:**
  - `dataverse-sdk-batch` - $batch operations with change sets
  - `dataverse-sdk-xrm` - OrganizationService facade
  - `dataverse-sdk-discovery` - Global Discovery Service (Commercial)

  **Typed Operations:**
  - `dataverse-sdk-actions` - 1,356 typed Web API actions
  - `dataverse-sdk-functions` - 229 typed Web API functions
  - `dataverse-sdk-messages` - 1,356 typed messages (direct exports)

  **Advanced:**
  - `dataverse-sdk-metadata` - Metadata operations + strict typing
  - `dataverse-sdk-files` - File/image column operations with chunking

  **Tooling:**
  - `dataverse-sdk-generator` - Early-bound entity generator

  **Telemetry (Optional):**
  - `dataverse-sdk-appinsights` - Application Insights adapter
  - `dataverse-sdk-otel` - OpenTelemetry adapter

  ## 🔄 Breaking Changes from Pre-Release

  ### Direct Exports (No Namespaces)

  **Previous (Pre-Release):**

  ```typescript
  import { XrmSdkMessages, CrmSdkMessages } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-messages";
  const request = new XrmSdkMessages.WhoAmIRequest();
  ```

  **Now (v1.0):**

  ```typescript
  import { ExecuteWorkflowRequest, MergeRequest } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-messages";
  const request = new ExecuteWorkflowRequest("workflow-id", "entity-id", {});
  ```

  **Rationale:** Direct named exports enable better tree-shaking, simpler imports, and align with modern ESM practices.

  ### Constructor Signatures

  Auto-generated message/action/function classes use positional constructor parameters rather than options objects. Refer to package READMEs and IntelliSense for specific signatures.

  ## 📚 Documentation
  - **ADRs:** Comprehensive architecture decision records in `docs/adr/`
  - **Mapping Docs:** Web API action/function/message mappings in `docs/mapping/`
  - **Samples:** 7 working samples demonstrating key patterns
  - **Package READMEs:** Installation and usage for each package

  ## ⚡ Quick Start

  ```bash
  # Install core + auth
  pnpm add @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-core @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-auth-msal-node

  # For OrganizationService pattern
  pnpm add @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-xrm @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-messages

  # For batch operations
  pnpm add @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-batch

  # For file operations
  pnpm add @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-files
  ```

  **Fluent API Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { DataverseClient } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-core";
  import { MsalNodeTokenProvider } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-auth-msal-node";

  const client = new DataverseClient({
    baseUrl: "https://org.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2",
    tokenProvider: new MsalNodeTokenProvider(msalConfig),
  });

  const accounts = await client
    .api("/accounts")
    .select(["name", "revenue"])
    .filter("revenue gt 100000")
    .top(10)
    .get();
  ```

  **OrganizationService Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { OrganizationService } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-xrm";
  import { ExecuteWorkflowRequest } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-messages";

  const service = new OrganizationService(client);

  const request = new ExecuteWorkflowRequest("workflow-id", "entity-id", {});
  const response = await service.execute(request);
  ```

  ## ⚠️ Known Limitations
  1. **Integration Tests:** Unit tests comprehensive; integration tests require live Dataverse environment (deferred to v1.0.1)
  2. **Actions Package Tests:** 18 test failures due to constructor signature mismatches with auto-generated classes (functionality confirmed working in samples)
  3. **SPA Sample:** Skeleton only (deferred to v1.0.1)

  ## 🔮 Roadmap

  **v1.0.1 - Polish Release** (Planned: +2 weeks)
  - Complete SPA Fluent UI v9 sample
  - Enhanced package READMEs
  - Migration guides
  - Troubleshooting documentation
  - Fix actions package test implementation

  **v1.1 - Fast-Follow** (Planned: +3 months)
  - Duplicate detection package
  - Stream-based file operations
