# @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-auth-msal-node

## 2.0.0-beta.0

### Major Changes

- bc53abf: The device code, authorization code and username/password flows sign in once, then go silent (#85). `@azure/msal-node` is now a **peer dependency**.

  The core client asks for a token on every request, and before this change these flows went to Entra ID every time: device code showed a new prompt on **every API call**, the single-use authorization code was redeemed again on the second request (which failed), and username/password sent the password on every request.

  - **Device code / username/password:** the first `getToken()` signs in; later calls use `acquireTokenSilent` with the signed-in account (MSAL's cache, then its refresh token). They sign in again only when MSAL says the account needs it (`InteractionRequiredAuthError`). Concurrent first requests share one sign-in, so the user sees one prompt.
  - **Authorization code:** the code is redeemed once. Later calls go silent; when a new sign-in is needed, `getToken()` throws `DataverseAuthenticationError` instead of redeeming the spent code again.
  - `TokenOptions.forceRefresh` (after a 401) reaches `acquireTokenSilent` in these flows too, so the retry uses the refresh token.
  - MSAL failures keep the MSAL error as `cause` on the `DataverseAuthenticationError` (`TokenAcquisitionFailed`).

  **Install change:** `@azure/msal-node` moved from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` (`^2.16.3 || ^3.0.0 || ^5.0.0 || ^6.0.0 || ^7.0.0`). The package imports only MSAL's types and checks the client application by its methods instead of `instanceof`, so an application from the app's own MSAL copy, of any of those majors, is accepted, and no second MSAL copy is installed. If your app didn't list `@azure/msal-node` itself, add it:

  ```bash
  npm install @azure/msal-node
  ```

  The constructor, `new MsalNodeTokenProvider(clientApplication, { flow, scopes, … })`, is unchanged.

- d9eebf3: **2.0.0.** Every package moves to 2.0.0 together. Most of 2.0 fixes code that didn't work against Dataverse in 1.0, and several changes alter existing behaviour. See [docs/migration-2.0.md](https://github.com/mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-typescript/blob/main/docs/migration-2.0.md) for what to change. In short:

  - **Install:** Node 22+. `@azure/msal-browser`, `@azure/msal-node`, and the OpenTelemetry and Azure Monitor packages are now peer dependencies of the auth and telemetry packages (#24, #85, #159).
  - **core:** nothing is logged by default. URLs in logs and telemetry are redacted.
  - **core, retries:** a `Retry-After` beyond `retry.maxRetryAfterMs` (30 s) is returned instead of waited out, and non-idempotent requests aren't replayed after 502/503/504.
  - **core, timeouts:** `timeoutMs` covers the whole request.
  - **core, pipeline:** the default middleware order is ODataHeaders, Retry, Concurrency, Auth, Telemetry, Logging.
  - **core, queries:** query options are encoded with `%20`, and `expand()` calls add up.
  - **core, removed options:** `RetryOptions.delay` and `useExponentialBackoff`, `circuitBreaker`, `bulkhead` and `DataverseError.statusCode` are gone (#285).
  - **errors:** every SDK error extends `DataverseError`. Network failures and aborts are `DataverseNetworkError` and `DataverseAbortError`. A 412 is a `DataverseDuplicateError` only for `0x80040333`.
  - **metadata:** enums are string member names, and creates return the id from `OData-EntityId`.
  - **xrm:** record ids must be GUIDs, and entity sets come from metadata. `execute()` infers its result from the request, and records are `EntityRecord` instead of `any`.
  - **discovery:** `OrganizationDetail` matches the v2.0 response.
  - **actions, functions, messages:**
    - constructors take one object with the parameters by name; a bound operation's record id or entity set comes first, and bulk operations take the entity set first (#96);
    - each binding of an overloaded operation has its own class, and the plain-name classes of bound-only operations are removed (#286);
    - one `EntityReference` for the whole SDK: `createEntityReference` returns the Web API shape and takes an options object (#295);
    - `client.execute()` resolves the operation's value, not the OData envelope: the entity (`null` for a 204), the array, the primitive, or nothing (#300);
    - `toRequestBody()` is removed.

  See each package's CHANGELOG for the full list.

### Minor Changes

- 87994ff: `MsalNodeTokenProvider`: configured claims no longer bypass MSAL's token cache, `tenantId` stays in the configured cloud and works for every flow, and MSAL's error details are on the thrown error (#382).

  - **Configured `claims`.** MSAL skips its token cache for any request with `claims`, and the provider sent the `claims` option on every silent and client credentials call, so every Dataverse request went to Entra ID. They are now sent only when the request goes to Entra ID anyway: the sign-in (device code, authorization code, username/password), the first token for each scope set, tenant and account, and a forced refresh. A claims challenge from a 401 (`TokenOptions.claims`) is still always sent. With MSAL Node 7, client credentials also send them as `claimsFromClient`, which MSAL caches by value.
  - **`tenantId` in sovereign clouds.** Client credentials built `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenantId>` whatever the application's cloud, so a US Government or China app got a public cloud authority. The authority now keeps the host of the application's configured authority, or its `azureCloudOptions` cloud (the request then carries `azureCloudOptions` for the tenant, since MSAL ignores a request's `authority` without them). The tenant is validated: a value that isn't a tenant id or domain throws `DataverseInvalidRequestError` (`name: "InvalidTenantId"`), from the constructor for `ClientCredentialsFlowOptions.tenantId` and before MSAL is called for `TokenOptions.tenantId`.
  - **`TokenOptions.tenantId` for user flows.** Device code, authorization code, username/password and silent ignored it, so a guest-tenant request got a home-tenant token and then a 401. Device code and username/password now sign in to that tenant, silent calls send it as their authority, and the authorization code is redeemed where it was issued, then the tenant's token comes from the signed-in account's refresh token.
  - **Error details.** MSAL failures are thrown as the new `MsalNodeAuthenticationError` (still a `DataverseAuthenticationError`, `name` `"TokenAcquisitionFailed"`) with MSAL's `errorCode` (also as `code`), `subError`, `correlationId` and `errorNo`, and the MSAL error as `cause`, like the browser package's `MsalBrowserAuthenticationError`.
  - **Username/password.** MSAL Node has deprecated `acquireTokenByUsernamePassword`. The constructor now throws `DataverseInvalidRequestError` naming the method when the application doesn't have it, instead of a `TypeError` on the first `getToken()`.

### Patch Changes

- 40ed643: Raise the minimum versions of runtime dependencies to current releases within the same major version: `@azure/monitor-opentelemetry` ^1.20.1, `@azure/msal-browser` ^3.30.0, `@azure/msal-node` ^2.16.3, and `chalk`/`commander`/`ora` for the generator CLI. Installs then resolve to releases without known high or critical advisories. The MSAL and Azure Monitor packages later became peer dependencies (#24, #85, #159), and these versions are the lowest their peer ranges accept.
- 254a8ec: No `any` in the public API. **Breaking for TypeScript callers.**

  - **batch:** `BatchResponseStep.body` and `BatchResponsePart.body` are `unknown`. Both types take a generic for the body, `BatchResponseStep<TBody = unknown>`, so name the type of a response you know (`result.responses.get("who") as BatchResponseStep<WhoAmIResponse> | undefined`) or check the value. The request body of `addRequest()` and `BatchRequestStep` is `unknown`; every value is still accepted.
  - **entities-runtime:** `IEntity`'s index signature is `[key: string]: unknown`. Declared columns keep their types; any other property must be checked before use.
  - **core:** `DataverseServiceError.fromResponse(response, body?)` takes `body` as `unknown` and reads `code` and `message` only when they are strings. A response body that isn't JSON is kept as the text instead of making `fromResponse()` throw. `DataverseBatchError<TResult, TStep>` defaults its type parameters to `unknown` instead of `any` (the batch package still narrows them).
  - **auth-msal-node, generator:** internal `as any` casts replaced with narrowing; no behaviour change.

- 6bbb784: Declare `engines: { "node": ">=22" }`. Node 18 and Node 20 are end of life (April 2025 and April 2026). CI now tests on Node 22, 24 and 26. Installing on an older Node shows an engine warning, or fails with `engine-strict`.
- 05a489a: The token providers act on `TokenOptions.forceRefresh` (#167), which the core client sets after a 401 (#21). Before, the 401 retry could receive the same cached token again.

  - **msal-node:** passes `skipCache: true` for client credentials, and `forceRefresh` in the silent flow.
  - **msal-browser:** passes `forceRefresh: true` to `acquireTokenSilent`.
  - **azure-identity:** `@azure/identity` has no refresh option, so the provider ignores `forceRefresh` and leaves caching to each credential; this is documented. A claims challenge is still passed on.

  ## 🔄 Breaking Changes from Pre-Release

  ### Direct Exports (No Namespaces)

  **Previous (Pre-Release):**

  ```typescript
  import { XrmSdkMessages, CrmSdkMessages } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-messages";
  const request = new XrmSdkMessages.WhoAmIRequest();
  ```

  **Now (v1.0):**

  ```typescript
  import { ExecuteWorkflowRequest, MergeRequest } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-messages";
  const request = new ExecuteWorkflowRequest("workflow-id", "entity-id", {});
  ```

  **Rationale:** Direct named exports enable better tree-shaking, simpler imports, and align with modern ESM practices.

  ### Constructor Signatures

  Auto-generated message/action/function classes use positional constructor parameters rather than options objects. Refer to package READMEs and IntelliSense for specific signatures.

  ## 📚 Documentation
  - **ADRs:** Comprehensive architecture decision records in `docs/adr/`
  - **Mapping Docs:** Web API action/function/message mappings in `docs/mapping/`
  - **Samples:** 7 working samples demonstrating key patterns
  - **Package READMEs:** Installation and usage for each package

  ## ⚡ Quick Start

  ```bash
  # Install core + auth
  pnpm add @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-core @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-auth-msal-node

  # For OrganizationService pattern
  pnpm add @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-xrm @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-messages

  # For batch operations
  pnpm add @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-batch

  # For file operations
  pnpm add @mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-files
  ```

  **Fluent API Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { DataverseClient } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-core";
  import { MsalNodeTokenProvider } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-auth-msal-node";

  const client = new DataverseClient({
    baseUrl: "https://org.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2",
    tokenProvider: new MsalNodeTokenProvider(msalConfig),
  });

  const accounts = await client
    .api("/accounts")
    .select(["name", "revenue"])
    .filter("revenue gt 100000")
    .top(10)
    .get();
  ```

  **OrganizationService Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { OrganizationService } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-xrm";
  import { ExecuteWorkflowRequest } from "@mohsinonxrm/dataverse-sdk-messages";

  const service = new OrganizationService(client);

  const request = new ExecuteWorkflowRequest("workflow-id", "entity-id", {});
  const response = await service.execute(request);
  ```

  ## ⚠️ Known Limitations
  1. **Integration Tests:** Unit tests comprehensive; integration tests require live Dataverse environment (deferred to v1.0.1)
  2. **Actions Package Tests:** 18 test failures due to constructor signature mismatches with auto-generated classes (functionality confirmed working in samples)
  3. **SPA Sample:** Skeleton only (deferred to v1.0.1)

  ## 🔮 Roadmap

  **v1.0.1 - Polish Release** (Planned: +2 weeks)
  - Complete SPA Fluent UI v9 sample
  - Enhanced package READMEs
  - Migration guides
  - Troubleshooting documentation
  - Fix actions package test implementation

  **v1.1 - Fast-Follow** (Planned: +3 months)
  - Duplicate detection package
  - Stream-based file operations
